Greetings. My name is Evan Krell. I was born in Corpus Christi, a coastal city situated on the Gulf of Mexico in South Texas. It is here that I completed both my bachelors and masters in Computer Science at <i><b>Texas A&M University — Corpus Christi (TAMUCC)</b></i>. Despite encouragement to explore further afield, I am now pursuing a <i><b>PhD in Geospatial Computer Science</b></i> at the same. 
</p>

<p>
While I am interested very broadly in solving problems using computer science, I have a general focus on coastal and marine applications. I have worked on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C">DNA metabarcoding to identify the diets of fish based on their gut contents</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC">energy-efficient path planning for autonomous surface vessels</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C">AI modeling for coastal fog prediction</a>. While much of my research focuses on solving local problems in the South Texas Coastal Bend, I use these applications as case studies for developing novel methods with broad application. 
</p>

<p>
Growing up in Corpus Christi, I've been able to pursue interests in various aquatic activities. Among the best ways to enjoy the city's many bodies of water include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2hozLg7lqc">kayaking and exploring spoil islands in the Laguna Madre</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxlbk_K9zCw">catching tonight's dinner with my family</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qheI5x0CfgM">participating in local regattas in Corpus Christi Bay</a>. It is not by accident that my research and personal interests are so strongly aligned. My ideal situation is when the line between work and play is blurred. It is not unlikely for me to attend a remote meeting from aboard a kayak, while spending the day fishing and collecting underwater imagery datasets for computer vision research.

    <p>
      The <a href="http://icore.tamucc.edu/">innovation in COmputer REsearch (iCORE)</a> lab at TAMUCC is a multidisciplinary research group where members from various backgrounds collaborate to solve problems using computer science techniques. We apply AI, computer vision, simulation, et al. to tackle problems in robotics, atmospheric science, smart agriculture, and more. At iCORE, I work on AI modeling and autonomous vehicles. I am also more or less in charge of organizing the lab’s many public events and workshops as well as maintaining a <a href="https://github.com/ekrell/icore_website/tree/main/news">weekly newsletter</a>.

I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.conradblucherinstitute.org/">Conrad Blucher Institute</a>, and more specifically the <a href="https://www.coastaldynamicslab.org/">Coastal Dynamics Lab (CDL)</a> within it. Here, I apply artificial intelligence for coastal modeling applications. I am currently developing eXplainable AI (XAI) techniques to help us understand how geoscience models that rely on high-dimensional raster predictors are making their decisions. This research was motivated by challenges in using existing XAI techniques to explain <a href="https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/fognet/">FogNet</a>, a deep-learning architecture for predicting coastal fog.

Finally, I am part of the <a href="https://www.ai2es.org/">NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES)</a>. Besides developing high performance AI models, we have a core focus on the explainability and trustworthiness of those models. We work with stakeholders to develop models that meet their needs, and use XAI and other techniques to improve trust in the model, capture uncertainty, etc.
