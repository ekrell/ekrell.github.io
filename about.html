        <h1>About</h1>
    </center>
    <p>
    Greetings. My name is Evan Krell. I was born in Corpus Christi, a coastal city situated on the Gulf of Mexico in South Texas. It is here that I completed both my bachelors and masters in Computer Science at <i><b>Texas A&M University â€” Corpus Christi (TAMUCC)</b></i>. Despite encouragement to explore further afield, I am now pursuing a <i><b>PhD in Geospatial Computer Science</b></i> at the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
    While I am interested very broadly in solving problems using computer science, I have a general focus on coastal and marine applications. I have worked on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C">DNA metabarcoding to identify the diets of fish based on their gut contents</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC">energy-efficient path planning for autonomous surface vessels</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C">AI modeling for coastal fog prediction</a>. While much of my research focuses on solving local problems in the South Texas Coastal Bend, I use these applications as case studies for developing novel methods with broad application. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Growing up in Corpus Christi, I've been able to pursue interests in various aquatic activities. Among the best ways to enjoy the city's many bodies of water include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2hozLg7lqc">kayaking and exploring spoil islands in the Laguna Madre</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxlbk_K9zCw">catching tonight's dinner with my family</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qheI5x0CfgM">participating in local regattas in Corpus Christi
        Bay</a>. It is not by accident that my research and personal interests are so strongly aligned: my ideal situation is when the line between work and play is blurred.

    <p>
The <a href="http://icore.tamucc.edu/">innovation in COmputer REsearch (iCORE)</a> lab at TAMUCC is a multidisciplinary research group where members from various backgrounds work together to leverage computer science to solve problems. We apply AI, computer vision, simulation, etc to  robotics, atmospheric science, smart agriculture, and more. At iCORE, my focus is on artificial intelligence for autonomous vehicles and geoscience applications. I have had opportunities to mentor undergrads in multiple robotics and AI projects. iCORE is slightly unusual in being both a lab and what could be called a venue for public events. Throughout the semester, we hold a diverse variety of trainings and events available to students and faculty as well as attendees from outside campus. I am more or less in charge of organizing iCORE's meetings and events, as well as maintaining a <a href="https://github.com/ekrell/icore_website/tree/main/news">weekly newsletter</a>.

    The <a href="https://www.conradblucherinstitute.org/">Conrad Blucher Institute for Surveying and Science (CBI)</a> is a research institute at TAMUCC that includes several labs. CBI is broadly concerned with the application of geospatial sciences for data-driven decision making. In addition to fundamental research, there is an emphasis on coastal applications to support local stakeholders in the Texas Coastal Bend. As part of the the <a href="https://www.coastaldynamicslab.org/">Coastal
        Dynamics Lab (CDL)</a>, my research focuses on eXplainable AI for geoscience models whose input
    predictors are high-dimensional rasters. <a href="https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/fognet/">FogNet</a> is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network for predicting coastal fog that relies on a raster containing 384 channels of NWP model output combined with satellite-measured Sea Surface Temperature. My role was initially to apply XAI techniques to help us investigate the strategies used by FogNet so that we could improve the model and gain trust from local forecasters who could use it. After identifying a number of challenges, I am now
focusing on novel XAI techniques to improve explanations for geoscience models in general.

The <a href="https://www.ai2es.org/">NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES)</a> is multi-sector institute that includes academic, industry, and government lab partners. The goal is develop trustworthy AI for applications in environmental science. While it is critical to achieve high performance models to characterize complex environmental phenomena, AI2ES strives to achieve trustworthy AI in several ways. For example, by
working closely with stakeholders to ensure that the developed systems align well with user needs. Another major component of trustworthy AI is to understand how the models make their decisions. My XAI research conducted as part of CDL is also part of AI2ES. In addition to my primary XAI research, I am involved with multiple collaborations among AI2ES partners.

    The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/islandersailing/">Islander Sailing Club</a> is TAMUCC's student organization dedicated to the sport and joy of sailing. Thanks to our relationship with the <a href="https://www.ccyc.com/">Corpus Christi Yacht Club (CCYC)</a>, students are able to sail several <a href="https://youtu.be/oFwC9ZlbAvY">International 420 Dingies</a> and two <a href=" https://youtu.be/a5Hg0G3ingU ">Interclub Dingies</a>. Using these vessels, we sail in Corpus Christi Bay whenever the winds are willing to cooperate. No experience is expected from new
members, and it is common for members to go from having never been afloat to competing in regattas against other schools within a semester. Whether you are interested in casual sailing or competition, there are many opportunities to sail. I serve as the club's treasurer. An understandable mistake would be to assume that since I am an officer of a sailing club that I am any good at sailing. My current mobile phone is a waterproof model due to an incident in which I remembered during a
capsize that I forgot to remove my previous phone from my life vest.

<h2>Panoply Cyber Defense Competition: Winner</h2>
<h3>2014</h3>
<p>
<p>
During undergrad, I was a member of the <a href="https://www.tamucc.edu/engineering/departments/computing-sciences/computer-science/cyber-defense/student-resources.php">Cyber Defense Team</a> and competed in a few competitions. 
Our team took first place in the <a href="https://cyberpanoply.com/index.html">2014 Panoply competition</a>. Our team of four was composed of Brad Hanna, Dustin McManus, Francisco Elizalde, and myself. Given a network containing a number of vulnerable machines, points were awarded for a successful penetration. I recall making one or <i>possibley</i> two intelligence decisions over the course of the event. 
</p>


<h2>Genomics Core Lab</h2>
<h3>2016 - 2018</h3>
<div class="about_row">
  <div class="about_col">
<p>
My first research position was in the <a href="https://www.tamucc.edu/science/research/genomics/">Genomics Core Lab (GCL)</a> at TAMUCC.
As a computer science major, my role was to bring the <i>informatics</i> to <i>bioinformatics</i>. 
My main project was the development of a DNA metabarcoding pipeline called <a href="https://github.com/cbirdlab/charybdis">Charybdis</a>.
The code is a combination of shell scripts for parallel execution of a sequence of barcoding tools, as well as several R scripts for analysis of the results.
This pipeline was used by Drymon et al. for <a href="https://afspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nafm.10293">Genetic Identification of Species Responsible for Depredation in Commercial and Recreational Fisheries</a>. 
I also developed training material to help students and faculty in the life science with programming and using Linux. 
<a href="https://github.com/ekrell/hpc-dna-tutorial">HPC DNA Tutorial</a> introduces users to processes DNA sequence data on multi-node HPC systems.

<h2>NASA UTL-4 with Lonestar UAS</h2>
<h3>Summer 2019</h3>
<p>

In 2019, TAMUCC and Lonestar UAS were involved with <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/utm">NASA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM)</a>.
UTM was a large, multi-year program to demostrate safe and efficient management of multiple unmanned aircraft over urban environments. 
Downtown Corpus Christi was the site for Technical Capability Level (TCL) 4 (TCL-4) where seven different commercial servicers were 
involved with traffic manage for many vehicles engaged in a variety of operations. 
My role was to implement an autonomous Collision Avoidance System (CAS) for safe navigation. 
I combined three cameras to create a 180-degree field-of-view that could be processed online using a single-board computer mounted on the drone.
The goal was to collect realistic footage from the traffic operations that would be used later to evalute CAS algorithms.
However, the vehicle was lost early on in the mission after a sudden loss of power and falling into Corpus Christi Bay. 
The only data captured was the short bit of footage over Downtown CC below.

<h2>Coastal Bend Joint Task Force on COVID-19</h2>
<h3>2020 - 2021</h3>
<div class="about_row">
    <div class="about_col">
<p>
I was part of the <a href="">joint task force</a> between TAMUCC, the City of Corpus Christi, and Nueces County that was established to model the potential impact of COVID-19 on the Coastal Bend. 
  The task force used a data-driven approach to tailor models to the region by incorporating local COVID-19 data and hospital capacities. 
  An online dashboard was maintained with up-to-do COVID-19 stats and model predictions.
  I was involved with maintanance of the online dashboard and scraping web sources to compile the input data for our models. 
  In addition, I served as all-around tech support and available practically 24/7 to ensure that the model was up-to-date and operational.
  Every week, the task force presented an update to the public during the City of Corpus Christi Friday Press Conference.
  This meant that Thursdays were very often a struggle to restore the model to working order after one of our many input data sources
  changed their format once again.
