        <h1>About</h1>
    </center>
    <p>
    Greetings. My name is Evan Krell. I was born in Corpus Christi, a coastal city situated on the Gulf of Mexico in South Texas. It is here that I completed both my bachelors and masters in Computer Science at <i><b>Texas A&M University â€” Corpus Christi (TAMUCC)</b></i>. Despite encouragement to explore further afield, I am now pursuing a <i><b>PhD in Geospatial Computer Science</b></i> at the same. 
    </p>
    <p>
    While I am interested very broadly in solving problems using computer science, I have a general focus on coastal and marine applications. I have worked on <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C">DNA metabarcoding to identify the diets of fish based on their gut contents</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC">energy-efficient path planning for autonomous surface vessels</a>, and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=jLuwYGAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=jLuwYGAAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C">AI modeling for coastal fog prediction</a>. While much of my research focuses on solving local problems in the South Texas Coastal Bend, I use these applications as case studies for developing novel methods with broad application. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Growing up in Corpus Christi, I've been able to pursue interests in various aquatic activities. Among the best ways to enjoy the city's many bodies of water include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2hozLg7lqc">kayaking and exploring spoil islands in the Laguna Madre</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cxlbk_K9zCw">catching tonight's dinner with my family</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qheI5x0CfgM">participating in local regattas in Corpus Christi
        Bay</a>. It is not by accident that my research and personal interests are so strongly aligned: my ideal situation is when the line between work and play is blurred.

    <p>
The <a href="http://icore.tamucc.edu/">innovation in COmputer REsearch (iCORE)</a> lab at TAMUCC is a multidisciplinary research group where members from various backgrounds work together to leverage computer science to solve problems. We apply AI, computer vision, simulation, etc to  robotics, atmospheric science, smart agriculture, and more. At iCORE, my focus is on artificial intelligence for autonomous vehicles and geoscience applications. I have had opportunities to mentor undergrads in multiple robotics and AI projects. iCORE is slightly unusual in being both a lab and what could be called a venue for public events. Throughout the semester, we hold a diverse variety of trainings and events available to students and faculty as well as attendees from outside campus. I am more or less in charge of organizing iCORE's meetings and events, as well as maintaining a <a href="https://github.com/ekrell/icore_website/tree/main/news">weekly newsletter</a>.

    The <a href="https://www.conradblucherinstitute.org/">Conrad Blucher Institute for Surveying and Science (CBI)</a> is a research institute at TAMUCC that includes several labs. CBI is broadly concerned with the application of geospatial sciences for data-driven decision making. In addition to fundamental research, there is an emphasis on coastal applications to support local stakeholders in the Texas Coastal Bend. As part of the the <a href="https://www.coastaldynamicslab.org/">Coastal
        Dynamics Lab (CDL)</a>, my research focuses on eXplainable AI for geoscience models whose input
    predictors are high-dimensional rasters. <a href="https://gridftp.tamucc.edu/fognet/">FogNet</a> is a 3D Convolutional Neural Network for predicting coastal fog that relies on a raster containing 384 channels of NWP model output combined with satellite-measured Sea Surface Temperature. My role was initially to apply XAI techniques to help us investigate the strategies used by FogNet so that we could improve the model and gain trust from local forecasters who could use it. After identifying a number of challenges, I am now
focusing on novel XAI techniques to improve explanations for geoscience models in general.

The <a href="https://www.ai2es.org/">NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES)</a> is multi-sector institute that includes academic, industry, and government lab partners. The goal is develop trustworthy AI for applications in environmental science. While it is critical to achieve high performance models to characterize complex environmental phenomena, AI2ES strives to achieve trustworthy AI in several ways. For example, by
working closely with stakeholders to ensure that the developed systems align well with user needs. Another major component of trustworthy AI is to understand how the models make their decisions. My XAI research conducted as part of CDL is also part of AI2ES. In addition to my primary XAI research, I am involved with multiple collaborations among AI2ES partners.

    <p>
    The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/islandersailing/">Islander Sailing Club</a> is TAMUCC's student organization dedicated to the sport and joy of sailing. Thanks to our relationship with the <a href="https://www.ccyc.com/">Corpus Christi Yacht Club (CCYC)</a>, students are able to sail several <a href="https://youtu.be/oFwC9ZlbAvY">International 420 Dingies</a> and two <a href=" https://youtu.be/a5Hg0G3ingU ">Interclub Dingies</a>. Using these vessels, we sail in Corpus Christi Bay whenever the winds are willing to cooperate. No experience is expected from new
members, and it is common for members to go from having never been afloat to competing in regattas against other schools within a semester. Whether you are interested in casual sailing or competition, there are many opportunities to sail. I serve as the club's treasurer. An understandable mistake would be to assume that since I am an officer of a sailing club that I am any good at sailing. My current mobile phone is a waterproof model due to an incident in which I remembered during a
capsize that I forgot to remove my previous phone from my life vest.
